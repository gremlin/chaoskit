export const pageTitle = 'Sass';

ChaosKit uses both [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) (the [Node](https://github.com/sass/node-sass) flavor) and [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/) to build styles.

### Rules

While nobody likes 'em, these rules are in-place to ensure the ongoing quality of the codebase:

- We have 4 distinct breakpoints: small `480px` medium `768px` large `960px` and xlarge `1200px`. Please do not introduce a new one.
- Never use IDs as styling hooks. Those are for JS and links.
- Optimize for less specificity. Instead of `div.box`, do `.box`
- Avoid nesting. Instead of `.box .button` do `.button`

### Naming conventions

We write our styles in an object oriented CSS methodology called [BEM](https://en.bem.info/); which stands for Block, Element, Modifier. We have adopted Nicolas Gallagher's naming scheme, [SUIT](https://github.com/suitcss/suit/blob/master/doc/naming-conventions.md), which is as follows:

- **Blocks**; the top level components, are camel case. For instance, `.offCanvas`
- **Elements**; children of the block elements, are named like so: `.offCanvas-panel`
- **Modifier** classes are then applied to change the default block styles. For instance `.button--primary`

#### Page-specific styles

No-one likes one-offs, but depending on your project; like a marketing site - you may have the need to create styles that are meant to be used on a very specific page. We get around this by prefixing page-specific styles with the page name. If you're on a product page; prefix styles with `.product__`; like `.product__specialBox`. This; just like namespacing JavaScript classes/methods allows us to maintain a consistent class structure. Then, if you notice that you've re-used those same styles elsewhere; you can pull them out into a global file that has names that fit more within a global-scope; like `.specialBox`.

#### Breakpoints

To help us decipher components that are being impacted by a specific breakpoint, we use the `@` symbol attached to our classnames, like so: `.column-6@medium`. This translates to a six-column element that only inherits those styles on the medium breakpoint. We did this to avoid cases where: `.button--large` could be confused for a breakpoint instead of a size modifier.

**Note:** When writing your own breakpoint modifiers, remember to escape the `@` symbol. You can reference these classes without escaping within your HTML.

```scss
.myComponent {
  width: 200px;

  &\@medium {
    width: 400px;
  }
}

// Compiles to
.myComponent {
  width: 200px;
}

.myComponent\@medium {
  width: 400px;
}
```

### Structure

Every imported file within `framework.scss` is constructed via a mixin with the same name. The mixin is then called via a loop of components that can be modified as needed. This allows for a smarter inheritance system, variables scoped to the component file and easier overrides.

### Typical project structure

```scss
//
// Framework core
//

@import 'framework/core';

//
// Project overrides
//

@import 'site/framework/config';
@import 'site/framework/variables';
@import 'site/framework/button';

//
// Framework
//

@import 'framework/framework';

//
// Project
//

@import 'site/global';
```

**Note:** As a personal preference, we like to keep our framework overrides in a `/framework` directory within our projects, with each component in its own file â€” just as the framework does.

### Modify components

You can modify components three different ways:

#### Variables

Each component has a slew of variables that you can easily override in your project to fit your design needs.

```scss
// Overrides default `border-radius` set by the framework
$global-border-radius: 0;
```

#### Hooks

Hooks allow us to inject additional styles alongside components to reduce selectors.

```scss
// Example provided by framework
.box {
  position: relative;
  padding: $global-whitespace-large;
  border: 1px solid $global-border;
  border-radius: $global-border-radius;

  @if (mixin-exists(hook-box)) {
    @include hook-box();
  }
}

// Use of hook in project styles
@mixin hook-box() {
  &--small {
    padding: $global-whitespace-small;
  }
}

// Compiles to
.box {
  position: relative;
  padding: 32px;
  border: 1px solid #e0e0e0;
  border-radius: 3px;
}

.box--small {
  padding: 8px;
}
```

#### Extending

In a perfect-world, controlling DOM and utilizing utility classes is the bees-knees. In real-world applications; that's easier said than done. Thankfully, Sass has built-in support for extending portions of your codebase with their `@extend` directive. Extending classes however, can be a crap-shoot; as it duplicates every instance of that selector. That's why we've implemented `%placeholders` for some of our components; namely our utilities. You can use them like so:

```scss
.module-title {
  @extend %u-textFluid--h3-h4;
}
```

> Note
>
> Once Sass supports [dynamic mixin names](https://github.com/sass/sass/issues/626) we'll most likely move things over to them; since they can perform minutely better during GZIP compression.

#### Removing components

While we may be partial, you might not need all the magic our framework provides. In the interest of size, we provide a configurable `$components` array that you can interact with in two ways:

#### List components

This is a great option when you know the components that you want to use in your project.

```scss
$components: ('base', 'button');
```

#### Remove specific components

What if you want all components except just a few? We have a handy function that abstracts away funky file paths or duplication.

```scss
$components-to-remove: ('badge', 'toggle', 'tooltip');

// Run through above array of components to remove from list
@each $component in $components-to-remove {
  $components: remove($components, $component);
}
```
