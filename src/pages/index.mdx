# Overview

ChaosKit is a lightweight and modular front-end framework for developing fast and powerful web interfaces within Gremlin.

Emphasis is placed on base-styles that follow our [Sass guidelines](/sass/) with the flexibility of overriding portions to your needs with hooks, class modifiers, and variable overrides that make this framework extensible to fit both marketing and application initiatives.

## Installation (WIP)

```bash
yarn add chaoskit
```

> Note
>
> ChaosKit does not bundle an es5-version; so remember to include ChaosKit along with any [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) transformations as needed.

### Components

Components can be referenced like so:

```js
import { Button } from 'chaoskit/src/components'
```

You can also create a [Webpack alias](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/resolve/#resolve-alias).
